/**
Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:
- Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.
- Each number is used at most once.

Return a list of all possible valid combinations.
The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

Example 1:
	Input: k = 3, n = 7
	Output: [[1,2,4]]
	Explanation:
	1 + 2 + 4 = 7
	There are no other valid combinations.

Example 2:
	Input: k = 3, n = 9
	Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]
	Explanation:
	1 + 2 + 6 = 9
	1 + 3 + 5 = 9
	2 + 3 + 4 = 9
	There are no other valid combinations.

Example 3:
	Input: k = 4, n = 1
	Output: []
	Explanation: There are no valid combinations.
	Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.


Constraints:
	2 <= k <= 9
	1 <= n <= 60
